      Hello and welcome to Middbites, a personal project of mine that I designed and built into the web app that you're currently viewing.  The motivation for Middbites was simple: I wanted to create a platform for Middlebury College students to share their dining hall recipes. Our dining halls offer a lot of opportunity for culinary creativity, and many of us make full use of it. From paninis to salad and dessert recipes, there is a wealth of dining hall recipe gems out there. My hope is that Middbites will be a place for people to discover and share these recipes in a fun and social way.
    <p>
      Middbites also provides an intuitive dining hall menu page. The menu page was designed to quickly provide us with easy access to the thing we all want to know at least once in a day: what are we eating and where? The page, along with the entire website, is responsive and mobile-friendly so it looks great on your phones. Check it out at <a href="http://go/menuz">go/menuz</a>.

    <h4>Techy Stuff</h4>
    <p>
      If you happen to be interested, I have listed below most of the technologies used in the creation of middbites. 
    </p>


    <p>Middbites is the first web application I have built of this scale, and the first that will (hopefully) be facing a substantial amount of users. If a bug or two appears here and there, I'll do my best to resolve them quickly. You can help out by reporting problems as well. Also, my aim is to have Middbites be open-source, so check back here in the future for a link to the project's repository.</p>
